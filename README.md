 Digital Product Management Homework 7 - Web Forms

 Project Description
This web form serves as a tool for gathering data from students in the Business Analytics program at the University of Iowa, focusing on their academic experiences and personal demographics.

Best Practices for Forms
The web form aligns with several best practices to enhance user experience and data quality. To start, it employs clear and descriptive labeling for each input field, ensuring that users can easily understand what information is required. For instance, fields like 'Hometown' and 'Impression of the Major' have straightforward, descriptive labels. Additionally, mandatory fields are explicitly marked as 'required', guiding users through the form without confusion.

The form structure capitalizes on a variety of input typesâ€”text boxes, radio buttons, checkboxes, and dropdown lists. This variety not only caters to the specific type of data being collected (such as using dropdowns for state selection) but also enhances the ease of data entry. The thoughtful arrangement of these elements ensures a logical and user-friendly navigation path, allowing users to progress through the form naturally and intuitively.

Moreover, to prevent form abandonment and enhance user engagement, a responsive design and clear call-to-action buttons are implemented. The responsiveness of the form ensures that it is accessible and easy to use across a wide range of devices, while the visually appealing submit buttons encourage form completion.

Accessibility
In designing the form, particular attention has been paid to making it accessible to all users, adhering to WCAG 2.1, Level AA guidelines. This includes ensuring sufficient contrast ratios for text and background colors, which aids users with visual impairments. All form elements are labeled clearly and explicitly, making the form navigable by screen readers used by visually impaired individuals. Additionally, the entire form can be navigated using keyboard controls, catering to users who are unable to use a mouse. The implementation of tooltips not only offers additional information to users but is also designed in a way that doesn't hinder the form's accessibility, thereby ensuring inclusivity.
